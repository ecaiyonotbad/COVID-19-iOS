# COVID-19 Real-Time Tracker
This app displays real-time data of confirmed, deaths and recovered cases of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19).

Written in Swift 5, works well with iOS 13.1+, iPhone 11/XR screen size

Known issues:
- Haven't set constraints for different screen sizes

Future work:
- Using map kit to display data on a global map
- Using charts to display outbreak history
